How to use program:
1. Select image source folder (ex: SD card folder)
2. Open source folder when prompted
3. Begin sorting by inputting athlete's number in the 'Enter Folder Name' field.
4. Program should auto-sort images into respective folders after the first image of each athlete is sorted by program
	Ex: After the first image of player #4 is sorted, any future image you tag as #4 will be moved into player #4's folder. 

This is my first attempt at a proper Python project, so I am open to any and all feedback! Please post in the discussion section if you have any.
